Data collection for threat intelligence can be classified into following four types :
	1- Strategic Threat Intelligence Data Collection 
		Strategic threat intelligence data collection helps to perform the strategic analysis that can be used by high-level strategists and senior leaders within an organization to understand and predict risks and threats for the organization. 
	2- Operational Threat Intelligence Data Collection 
		Operational threat intelligence data collection involves **collecting actionable information** on any specific incoming attacks or events over an organizational network infrastructure. 
	3- Tactical Threat Intelligence Data Collection 
		Tactical threat intelligence deals with **tactics, techniques, and procedures of the threat groups** and should be most effectively used in defending the organization. It is mainly used by defensive information security personnel such as architects, administrators, security staff, etc. 
	4- Technical Threat Intelligence Data Collection 
		Technical threat intelligence deals mainly with the **technicalities of the attacker's assets and infrastructure**. Technical threat intelligence data consists of any information related to the threat machines IP address, Operating Systems, details about subnet, domain names of C2 headers, headers of the phishing emails, etc.
