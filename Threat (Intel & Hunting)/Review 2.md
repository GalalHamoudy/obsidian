### Where to Hunt?

#### 1. Network-based evidence: 
Look at logs, packet captures (PCAPs), NetFlow, firewall logs, IDS/IPS alerts, DNS logs, and proxy logs for malicious traffic or patterns.
#### 2. Host-based evidence: 
Focus on file systems, registry entries, memory dumps, event logs, and installed applications for signs of compromise like malware, unauthorized access, or abnormal behavior.
#### 3. Directed by initial lead: 
Investigate based on the nature of the initial alert or lead, such as suspicious IP traffic or unauthorized file modifications.
#### 4. Use existing resources: 
Leverage SIEM systems, threat intelligence, and forensic tools to scope the incident effectively and ensure comprehensive analysis across network and host systems
