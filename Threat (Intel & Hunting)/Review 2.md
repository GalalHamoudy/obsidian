### Where to Hunt?

#### 1. Network-based evidence: 
Look at logs, packet captures (PCAPs), NetFlow, firewall logs, IDS/IPS alerts, DNS logs, and proxy logs for malicious traffic or patterns.
#### 2. Host-based evidence: 
Focus on file systems, registry entries, memory dumps, event logs, and installed applications for signs of compromise like malware, unauthorized access, or abnormal behavior.
#### 3. Directed by initial lead: 
Investigate based on the nature of the initial alert or lead, such as suspicious IP traffic or unauthorized file modifications.
#### 4. Use existing resources: 
Leverage SIEM systems, threat intelligence, and forensic tools to scope the incident effectively and ensure comprehensive analysis across network and host systems

####  Do you have any experience developing threat models for organizations?

Threat modeling is an essential part of a threat intelligence analyst’s job. It involves understanding the potential threats an organization might face, and then developing strategies to mitigate those risks. It’s important for potential hires to have a good understanding of the process


---

**Q:** _How would you assess the quality of a threat intelligence feed before integrating it into your SIEM/SOC?_
**A:**
- **Relevance:** Does it align with our industry (e.g., financial sector vs. healthcare)?
- **False Positive Rate:** Test a sample of IOCs in a sandbox to see if they trigger malicious activity.
- **Timeliness:** Are indicators stale (e.g., domains registered years ago with no recent activity)?
- **Context:** Does it include TTPs, actor attribution, or just raw IOCs?
- **Operational Impact:** Will it overwhelm analysts with noise? (Example: A feed with 10,000 IPs but only 5% malicious is low-value.)


**Q:** _How would you differentiate between a state-sponsored attack and a cybercriminal operation based on incident artifacts?_
**A:**
- **Tradecraft:** State-sponsored actors use custom malware (e.g., APT29’s “WellMess”), while cybercriminals rely on commodity malware (e.g., Emotet, TrickBot).
- **Targeting:** APTs focus on long-term espionage (lateral movement, data exfiltration), while criminals go for quick financial gain (ransomware, credential theft).
- **Infrastructure:** APTs use bulletproof hosting or compromised legitimate domains; criminals favor disposable domains.
- **Persistence:** APTs invest in stealthy backdoors (e.g., webshells), while criminals may rely on scheduled tasks.
- **Intel Sources:** Check reports from Mandiant, CrowdStrike, or government advisories (CISA, NCSC) for overlaps.


**Q:** _You discover two malware campaigns using similar C2 infrastructure. How would you determine if they’re from the same threat actor or a false flag?
**A:**
- **Code Analysis:**
    - Compare **code signing certificates**, obfuscation methods, or API hashing.
- **Infrastructure Overlap:**
    - Check **shared IPs, registrant emails**, or TLS certificate issuers.
- **Victimology:**
    - Same industries? Geographic focus?
- **TTPs:**
    - Do both use **Cobalt Strike with similar sleep timers**?
    - Differences in **lateral movement** (WMI vs. PsExec)?
- **Attribution Warnings:**
    - **False flags** may mimic known groups (e.g., Chinese APTs using Russian malware).



**Q:** _How would you integrate OSINT, HUMINT, and SIGINT to profile a threat actor?_
**A:**
- **OSINT:**
    - **Dark web forums** (RaidsForums, XSS) for chatter.
    - **GitHub leaks** (malware source code, configs).
- **HUMINT:**
    - **Law enforcement liaisons** for insider info (e.g., arrested affiliates).
    - **Trusted industry sharing** (ISACs, closed Telegram groups).
- **SIGINT:**
    - **Intercepted C2 traffic** (if legally obtainable).
    - **SSL certificate patterns** (e.g., APT29’s use of Let’s Encrypt).
- **Correlation:**
    - Combine **forum aliases** with malware hashes.
    - Cross-check **Bitcoin wallets** from ransom payments with blockchain analysis.
