# Part 1 : incident Response & threat hunting

The NIST incident response lifecycle breaks incident response down into four main phases: Preparation; 
Detection and Analysis; 
Containment, Eradication, and Recovery; 
Post-Event Activity.

---
### **1. Preparation**  
**Goal:** Establish the foundation for effective incident response before an incident occurs.  

**Key Activities:**  
- Developing an **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**  
- Creating an **Incident Response Team (IRT)** with defined roles  
- Setting up **communication protocols** (e.g., contact lists, escalation paths)  
- Implementing **security controls** (firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoint protection)  
- Conducting **training and drills** (tabletop exercises, simulations)  
- Establishing **logging and monitoring** capabilities  
- Ensuring legal/regulatory compliance for incident handling

### **2. Detection & Analysis**  
**Goal:** Identify and assess potential security incidents.  

**Key Activities:**  
- **Monitoring** networks, systems, and logs for anomalies  
- **Alert triage** (determining if an event is a false positive or real incident)  
- **Incident validation** (confirming a security breach)  
- **Initial impact assessment** (scope, severity, affected systems)  
- **Prioritization** (based on risk to business operations)  
- **Documentation** (recording evidence for later analysis)  

**Common Detection Sources:**  
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) alerts  
- Antivirus/EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) alerts  
- User reports of suspicious activity  
- Threat intelligence feeds

### **3. Containment, Eradication, & Recovery**  
**Goal:** Mitigate the incident, remove threats, and restore normal operations.  

#### **A. Containment (Short-term & Long-term)**  
- **Short-term:** Immediate isolation (e.g., disconnecting infected systems, blocking malicious IPs)  
- **Long-term:** Applying patches, reconfiguring systems to prevent reinfection  

#### **B. Eradication**  
- Removing malware, backdoors, or attacker persistence mechanisms  
- Identifying root cause (e.g., phishing, unpatched vulnerability)  

#### **C. Recovery**  
- Restoring systems from clean backups  
- Rebuilding compromised systems securely  
- Validating that systems are clean before returning to production  
- Monitoring for signs of recurrence  

---
### **4. Post-Event Activity (Lessons Learned)**  
**Goal:** Improve future incident response efforts through review and refinement.  

**Key Activities:**  
- Conducting a **post-incident review meeting**  
- Documenting **lessons learned** (what worked, what failed)  
- Updating the **Incident Response Plan** based on findings  
- Improving **security controls** (e.g., patching, employee training)  
- Sharing findings with stakeholders (management, legal, PR if needed)  
- **Legal/regulatory follow-up** (e.g., breach notifications, compliance reports)

### Categories covered by the Windows Enterprise ATT&CK matrix

- Initial Access: The adversary is trying to get into your network.
- Execution: The adversary is trying to run malicious code.
- Persistence: The adversary is trying to maintain their foothold.
- Privilege Escalation: The adversary is hying to gain higher-level permissions.
- Defense Evasion: The adversary is trying to avoid being detected.
- Credential Access: The adversary is trying to steal account names and passwords.
- Discovery: The adversary is trying to figure out your environment.
- Lateral Movement: The adversary is trying to move through your environment.
- Collection: The adversary is trying to gather data of interest to their goal.
- Command and Control: The adversary is trying to communicate with compromised systems to control them.
- Exfiltration: The adversary is trying to steal data.
- Impact: The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data.
