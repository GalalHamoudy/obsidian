## Digital Forensics Process:

- Acquisition: a collection of digital media to be examined.
- Analysis: the actual examination of the media
- Presentation: The process by which the examiner shares the results of this analysis.

**Steganography** is the art and science of embedding secret messages in a cover message in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message.

**KAPE** (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor) is a digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tool designed to quickly collect and process forensic artifacts from Windows systems.

**Guymager** is an open-source forensic imaging tool designed for creating and verifying disk images. It is known for its speed, efficiency, and ease of use, making it a popular choice among digital forensic professionals.

### Security identifier (SID)

- Security identifier in Windows is a unique value used to identify any security entity that the Windows operating system (OS) can authenticate.

### Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) 

- is a Microsoft Windows component that allows the deeper inspection of built-in scripting services.

### Microsoft Management Console (MMC)

- It is a framework and application used for system administration tasks in Microsoft Windows operating systems. It provides a centralized and extensible platform for managing various aspects of a Windows-based computer or network. MMC serves as a container for various snap-ins, which are specialized management tools that can be added to the MMC interface to perform specific administrative tasks.

### Â Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

- It is a set of management and instrumentation technologies built into the Microsoft Windows operating system. It provides a standardized way for administrators and software developers to access and manipulate system resources, configurations, and performance data on Windows-based computers and servers. WMI is an integral part of the Windows operating system and plays a crucial role in system management, monitoring, and automation
