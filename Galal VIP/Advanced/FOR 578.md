## Lab 1.1 : structured analytic techniques (SATs)


In this lab, you will use two different types of structured analytic techniques (SATs). 

SATs are designed to help analysts perform analysis while abstracting themselves as much as possible from other influences such as bias. 
SATs can be leveraged for different types of analysis, including data organization, hypothesis generation, decision support, and conflict management. 

The SATs in this lab you will utilize are focused on data organization:  Simple Brainstorming and Sorting.

**Simple Brainstorming** is most often used at the beginning of a project to identify a list of relevant variables, key drivers, sources of information, possible outcomes or solutions, and other information that can get an analyst started thinking critically about a topic. The goal of brainstorming is to generate as many ideas as possible without beginning to apply analytic judgment during the process to avoid biases such as anchoring bias.

**example**: we have e-commerce > we write every things related to it and its important to take our care > we classified all the data into main points 

**Task** : Use Simple Brainstorming to identify relevant variables for research into ransomware attacks on the healthcare sector.

**Solve**: 
1- list the variables that will be useful to future research (at MindMup) 
2- we categorized all variables


**Sorting** is a way to structure and visualize variables of the topic you are looking into. It is a good technique for organizing
large bodies of data to generate insights. Sorting is most often done with a spreadsheet or database program so that data
can be sorted or organized in different ways. Sorting follows the general steps listed below:
- Step 1: Identify the variables or categories of a topic using a brainstorming method.
- Step 2: Make these categories column headers in a spreadsheet.
- Step 3: List facts, pieces of information, or hypotheses related to the categories in the appropriate column.
- Step 4: Review the sorted data for trends or anomalies and list them out as either findings or areas to look into more.
- Step 5: Review the findings, trends, and anomalies with others in your group; list and explain any variables you excluded or trends you discounted.

**example**: we use excel to write all data in table and categorized them into columns and rows .

Task : Use Sorting to identify relevant trends in phishing emails sent to the company. 

solve: 
1- we open task.csv file with excel 
2- in "Data" select "Sort" then select Expand the selection 
3- then we select which column to sort

## Lab 1.2: Consuming Along the Sliding Scale

The Sliding Scale of Cyber Security Model :
< 1 2 3 4 5 >
1- Architecture
2- passive defense
3- Active defense
4- intelligence
5- offense

the three applicable phases of the sliding scale:

- Architecture: Relates to the systems themselves, including a system of systems (such as networks) and their security. Design, supply chain, building, maintaining, etc., of the systems all fall into this category. An example would be including port mirroring on network switches to capture data, patching vulnerabilities, and generating new log types off systems for insight.
- Passive Defense: Relates to the systems placed on top of or in conjunction with other systems such as security tools. Anti-malware systems, endpoint protection, intrusion detection systems, log aggregators and analysis systems, and any other type of system or input into them that helps give visibility or performs automatic actions against adversaries and their capabilities.
- Active Defense: Relates to the human aspect of security against adversaries. Incident response, security operations, threat hunting, and other forms of reactive or proactive security where the human analyst is making decisions against the adversary or their capabilities.


Great! The **Sliding Scale of Cyber Security** is a conceptual model developed by **Robert M. Lee**, widely used in cyber threat intelligence and defense circles to illustrate the range of cybersecurity activities, from foundational defenses to offensive operations.
It presents cybersecurity as a **spectrum**, where different activities and capabilities **build on one another**, and are **increasingly sophisticated** from left to right:

### 🔒 **1. Architecture**

This is the **foundation** of cybersecurity.
- **Definition**: The design and implementation of secure systems and networks.
- **Focus**: Building systems with **security in mind** from the beginning (e.g., segmentation, least privilege, secure protocols).
- **Goal**: Prevent vulnerabilities and reduce attack surfaces.
- **Examples**:
    - Network segmentation
    - Secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC)
    - Access control models
    - Encryption standards

✅ Without good architecture, all other efforts are weakened.

### 🛡️ **2. Passive Defense**

These are the **standard security tools and configurations** used to defend against known threats.
- **Definition**: Security measures that operate without active engagement with the threat actor.
- **Focus**: Automated and preventive controls.
- **Goal**: Detect and stop **known or generic threats**.
- **Examples**:
    - Firewalls
    - Antivirus
    - Intrusion detection systems (IDS)
    - Patch management
    - Security configurations (e.g., disabling unused ports)

🟡 Limitations: Passive defenses are ineffective against advanced or novel threats.

### 🔍 **3. Active Defense**

Here, defenders begin to **interact with and respond to threats** in real-time.
- **Definition**: Proactive monitoring, deception, and threat hunting efforts.
- **Focus**: Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating **active adversaries** in the environment.
- **Goal**: Detect and remove intruders before they cause damage.
- **Examples**:
    - Threat hunting
    - Honeypots and deception technologies
    - Behavioral analysis
    - Incident response teams
    - Security Operations Centers (SOCs)

🟢 This is the "art of cyber defense" — dynamic, adaptive, and crucial against sophisticated threats.

### 🧠 **4. Intelligence**

This is where defenders use **knowledge about adversaries** to drive decision-making.
- **Definition**: Collection, analysis, and application of threat intelligence (TI).
- **Focus**: Understanding **who** the threat actors are, **how** they operate, and **why** they attack.
- **Goal**: Enable **anticipatory** and strategic defense.
- **Examples**:
    - Indicator of Compromise (IOC) feeds
    - Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) analysis (MITRE ATT&CK)
    - Attribution to threat actors/groups
    - Strategic threat reports (APT group activity, geopolitical context)

🔑 Intelligence feeds both active defense and strategic planning. It enables defenders to move from being reactive to **proactive**.

### ⚔️ **5. Offense**

This is the realm of **cyber operations**, typically conducted by **nation-states or specialized groups**.
- **Definition**: Activities that go beyond defense — aiming to **disrupt, degrade, or destroy** adversary systems.
- **Focus**: Exploitation, attack, and counter-operations.
- **Goal**: Achieve strategic or tactical advantage.
- **Examples**:
    - Exploit development
    - Penetration of adversary infrastructure
    - Red teaming (offensive emulation)
    - Government offensive cyber operations (e.g., Stuxnet)

⚠️ Offensive capabilities are rare and highly regulated; not typically part of commercial cybersecurity.

### 🧩 Putting It All Together

- The **left side (1-2)** is about **prevention** and system integrity.
- The **middle (3-4)** is where **real-time defense** and **strategic insight** occur.
- The **right side (5)** is where **nations and specialized actors** operate offensively.

## Lab 1.4: Strategic Threat Modeling

Develop a threat model 
1- from sources , identify priority intelligence requirements (PIRs)
2- brainstorming , sorting and documenting all findings
3- create MindMup with the company name and data sources (company information)
4- add all threats which has targeted the company before and linked it with the data sources (company information) which have been targeted 
5- add all threats which target the same company sector , then add thier tools and TTPs 

---

**Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs)** are a core concept in threat intelligence and are used to **focus intelligence efforts** on what matters most to decision-makers.

### 🔍 **Definition:**

> **Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs)** are **high-level questions** that guide the collection and analysis of threat intelligence to support specific business or security objectives.

They help threat intelligence teams prioritize **what to collect**, **who to monitor**, and **why it matters**.

### 🎯 **Purpose of PIRs:**

- Align intelligence with business and security needs
- Avoid information overload
- Focus limited resources on the most relevant threats
- Support decision-making during operations or investigations

### 🧠 **What Makes a Good PIR?**

A good PIR is:
- **Specific**: Focused on a threat, actor, asset, or behavior
- **Actionable**: The answer helps make a decision
- **Relevant**: Tied to the organization's risk or mission
- **Clear**: Easy to understand and measurable

### ✅ **Examples of PIRs:**

1. **"What APT groups are targeting our industry sector?"**
    - Helps security leadership plan defensive posture.
2. **"Are there any credible threats to our upcoming product launch?"**
    - Supports risk management and executive protection.
3. **"What TTPs are being used to exploit our VPN infrastructure?"**
    - Guides detection and hunting.
4. **"Have any of our credentials appeared on dark web forums?"**
    - Triggers remediation actions (e.g., password resets).

### 🔄 **PIRs Are Not Static**

PIRs should be **reviewed and updated regularly** based on:
- Changes in business priorities
- Evolving threat landscape
- New vulnerabilities or incidents

### 🧩 **PIRs in a Threat Intelligence Lifecycle**

They are part of the **Planning & Direction** phase and drive:
1. **Collection** → Gather relevant data
2. **Processing & Analysis** → Turn data into insights
3. **Dissemination** → Deliver intelligence that answers the PIRs
4. **Feedback** → Evaluate and adjust PIRs as needed

Creating **Strategic Threat Modeling** is a high-level, **intelligence-driven process** that helps organizations understand and anticipate **who might attack**, **why**, and **how**, so they can make better **strategic decisions**.

Unlike technical threat modeling (focused on systems or apps), **strategic threat modeling** focuses on:
- **Adversary motivations & capabilities**
- **Organizational risk and mission**
- **Long-term planning**

## 🧭 Steps to Create Strategic Threat Modeling

Here’s a practical, structured approach in **7 steps**:

### **1. Define Business & Strategic Objectives**

Start by understanding the **organization’s mission**, critical assets, and key goals.

✅ Questions to ask:
- What is the organization's core mission or service?
- What are the most valuable assets (data, systems, reputation)?
- What regulations or legal exposures exist?

🎯 **Goal**: Align security with business risk.

### **2. Identify the Threat Surface (Strategically)**

Map the **broad attack surface** from a strategic lens.

This includes:
- Geographic locations
- Supply chain or third-party partners
- Executive personnel
- Digital footprint (e.g., brand presence, cloud assets)

🎯 **Goal**: Understand where strategic risk exists.

### **3. Define Potential Adversaries**

Use threat intelligence to identify **who** would target the organization and **why**.

Include:
- **Nation-states**
- **Cybercriminal groups**
- **Hacktivists**
- **Insider threats**

Use frameworks like:
- MITRE ATT&CK for TTPs
- Threat actor profiles
- Industry-specific threat reports

🎯 **Goal**: Create adversary profiles relevant to your sector and region.

### **4. Understand Adversary Motivations & Objectives**

Now determine the **“why”** behind attacks:
- Financial gain
- Espionage
- Disruption
- Ideological motives
- Competitive advantage

Map this to **organizational impact** (e.g., data theft, service disruption, reputational damage).

🎯 **Goal**: Anticipate what attackers want and why they might come after you.

### **5. Map Adversary Capabilities & TTPs**

Identify the **tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** your adversaries use.

Resources:
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Past incident analysis
- Threat intelligence feeds

Focus on:
- How initial access is gained
- How persistence is maintained
- How exfiltration occurs

🎯 **Goal**: Know how adversaries operate, and where you are most vulnerable.

### **6. Assess Organizational Gaps & Risk**

Now compare **threat capabilities** to your **current defenses**.

Do a **gap analysis**:
- Are there key detection gaps?
- Are response plans in place for high-risk scenarios?
- Are business leaders aware of these threats?

Use tools like:

- Risk matrices
- Cyber Kill Chain or ATT&CK flow
- SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)

🎯 **Goal**: Prioritize mitigation, investment, or policy shifts.

### **7. Build Strategic Scenarios & Courses of Action**

Now turn the intelligence into **actionable strategic plans**.
- Build **threat scenarios** (e.g., ransomware by a criminal group or cyberespionage by a nation-state)
- Define **likely attack paths**
- Recommend **strategic responses**:
    - Investment in new tech
    - Executive awareness
    - Supply chain review
    - Red teaming

🎯 **Goal**: Provide leadership with clear, forward-looking options to reduce risk.

## 🧠 Tools, Frameworks & Models That Help

|Tool/Framework|Use in Strategic Threat Modeling|
|---|---|
|**MITRE ATT&CK**|Maps adversary behaviors & capabilities|
|**Cyber Kill Chain**|Tracks stages of an attack|
|**Diamond Model**|Analyzes adversary, infrastructure, capability, victim|
|**STIX/TAXII**|Structured threat data exchange|
|**PIRs**|Guides intelligence collection to inform strategy|

## 🧾 Output: What Should You Deliver?

A solid **Strategic Threat Model** typically results in:
- **Adversary profiles** (intent, capability, history)
- **Threat landscape summary** relevant to your org
- **Key risks and gaps**
- **Threat scenarios**
- **Recommendations for leadership**

What defines a capable CTI analyst? A CTI analyst can:
- Fully analyze successful and unsuccessful intrusions by targeted threat actors
- Construct descriptions of campaigns, actors, and organizations
- Seek out, collect, and properly exploit intelligence from others
- Generate intelligence from their own data sources and share it accordingly
- Manage intelligence to further the objectives of their organizations


Case Study : Moonlight Maze
- targeting government and military networks
- Russian hackers steal us weapons secret
- after discover the malware, the authors developed their toolkit based off LOKI2 "Penquin Turla" 


**Intelligence** is the collection, processing, and analysis of information about a competitive entity and its agents, needed by an organization or group for its security and well-being.
**Intelligence** is both a product and a process.


### Analysis Approaches in CTI

#### Data-Driven Analysis
- **Characteristics**:
  - Relies on high-quality datasets
  - Best for well-defined, straightforward problems
- **Accuracy Factors**:
  - Dependent on dataset accuracy and completeness
  - Results can be verified through dataset examination
- **Key Advantages**:
  - Logically-driven process
  - Easily replicated by other analysts
  - Transparent methodology

#### Conceptually-Driven Analysis
- **Characteristics**:
  - Deals with ambiguous situations
  - Handles undefined variables and relationships
- **Accuracy Factors**:
  - Relies on analyst's mental models
  - Improves through iterative feedback
- **Key Advantages**:
  - Enables rapid interpretation of complex concepts
  - Adaptable to novel threat scenarios
  - Valuable when data is limited

#### Application in CTI
- **Data-Driven**: Best for technical IOCs (IPs, hashes), malware analysis
- **Conceptually-Driven**: Essential for strategic threat assessments, adversary modeling

Tip: Effective CTI programs combine both approaches - using data-driven methods for tactical analysis and conceptually-driven methods for strategic insights.


الفقرة تتكلم عن دور المحلل الاستخباراتي، وتحديدًا عن ما يُسمى بـ "التحليل التحكيمي" أو **Analytic Judgment**.

المقصود هنا إن دور المحلل مش مجرد إنه يجمع معلومات عن حادث أو جهة معينة ويعرضها كحقائق، لكن عليه إنه يحلل ويفهم معنى المعلومات وتأثيرها على الجهة اللي بيشتغل لصالحها. التقييم ده هو اللي بنسميه **"التحليل التحكيمي"**.

التحليل ده بيكون بهدف تلبية متطلبات استخباراتية محددة، وبيعتمد على البيانات والمعلومات المتوفرة – حتى لو فيها فجوات أو في حاجات مش مؤكدة. الأحكام أو التقييمات دي ممكن تكون عن أحداث حصلت في الماضي (زي تحليل هدف وتأثير هجوم معين)، أو عن أحداث مستقبلية (زي التوقع بتأثير إجراء معين – مثلاً حظر الاتصال مع أنظمة القيادة والسيطرة).

لكن من المهم نعرف إن الأحكام دي ممكن يكون فيها نسبة خطأ، عشان كده لازم نفهم إزاي المحلل وصل للحكم ده.

في أدوات وأساليب بتساعد المحلل إنه يعمل التحليل ده، زي **Heuer’s Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)** أو **Lewin’s Force Field Analysis**. الأدوات دي بتساعد في تقييم المعلومات الحالية، وتحديد المعلومات الناقصة، وتُظهر المنهجية اللي اتبعها المحلل، وبالتالي يقدر "يعرض شغله" ويوضح ليه أصدر الحكم ده.


- **Analytic Judgment** = Assessment of what info means and how it impacts the organization.
- Judgments are based on **available data** + **acknowledgement of gaps/uncertainty**.
- Can be about **past events** (e.g. attack goal) or **future impact** (e.g. response action).
- Judgments are **not free from human error** → must understand the reasoning behind them.
- **Structured methodologies** help:
    - Heuer’s **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)**
    - **Lewin’s Force Field Analysis**
- These methods help:
    - **Assess info**
    - **Identify needed data**
    - **Highlight gaps**
    - **Show analyst’s reasoning ("show their work")**

### 🔍 **Types of Analysis That Lead to Analytic Judgments**

There are different types of analysis used in intelligence. There is no “one best method,” but some methods work better in certain situations. Two main types discussed here are:

---

### 📊 **1. Data-Driven Analysis**

- Based on existing data and pre-built models.
    
- Assumes the data and the model being used are accurate.
    
- Example: Virologists use data about viruses to predict how diseases will spread — intelligence analysts do similar things with military or political data.
    
- Models used: agent-based models, growth-matrix models, etc.
    
- Works well when there is **good, reliable data** available.
    
- Common use: analyze troop movements, assess military strength, or predict stability of governments.
    

---

### 💡 **2. Conceptually-Driven Analysis**

- Used more often in intelligence work because **accurate data is often missing**.
    
- In these cases, the analyst uses **mental models or theories** to understand the situation.
    
- The problem usually has many variables, and it’s unclear which ones are important.
    
- This kind of analysis doesn’t always lead to clear answers — analysts often say “**It depends**.”
    
- Very useful in situations of **uncertainty** where judgment is critical.
    
- Important to watch for **biases** in this kind of analysis.
    
- Structured techniques are helpful to make the analysis stronger.
    

---

### 📝 **Key Points to Remember**

- No single type of analysis fits all cases.
    
- **Data-driven analysis** works best with strong, accurate data.
    
- **Conceptually-driven analysis** is useful when data is missing or unclear.
    
- Both types have value — understanding when to use each is part of good intelligence work.




### أنواع التحليل التي تؤدي إلى الأحكام التحليلية (Analytic Judgments)

الفقرة بتتكلم عن أنواع التحليل اللي ممكن يستخدمها المحلل الاستخباراتي للوصول إلى حكم أو تقييم. مفيش نوع واحد هو الأفضل في كل الحالات، لكن في مواقف معينة نوع معين بيكون أنسب من غيره.

---

### 📊 **1. التحليل المعتمد على البيانات (Data-Driven Analysis)**

- بيعتمد على نماذج تحليلية جاهزة أو تم تطويرها مسبقًا.
    
- بيتبني على فرضية إن البيانات المتاحة والنموذج المستخدم دقيق ومناسب.
    
- مثال: علماء الفيروسات بيتوقعوا انتشار الأمراض باستخدام بيانات عن الفيروس نفسه، نفس الفكرة بيستخدمها المحللين العسكريين لتحليل قوة الجيوش أو تحركات القوات.
    
- النوع ده من التحليل بينفع لما تكون البيانات المتاحة دقيقة وموثوقة.
    
- بيستخدم في تحليل قدرات الجيوش، استقرار الحكومات الجديدة، وتحركات القوات.
    

---

### 💡 **2. التحليل القائم على المفاهيم أو النماذج الذهنية (Conceptually-Driven Analysis)**

- النوع ده بيُستخدم أكتر في مجال الاستخبارات لأن البيانات الدقيقة غالبًا مش متوفرة.
    
- المحلل بيستخدم **نموذج ذهني** أو **نظرية** لفهم الموقف.
    
- بيكون فيه عدد كبير من المتغيرات، وغالبًا مش واضح إيه المهم منها أو إزاي تأثر على بعضها.
    
- التحليل ده مش بيؤدي دايمًا لنتيجة واضحة، وغالبًا بنسمع فيه العبارة الشهيرة: **"It depends" (يعتمد على...)**.
    
- مفيد جدًا في حالات الغموض والشك، وده الوقت اللي بيكون فيه الحكم التحليلي مطلوب بشدة.
    
- لازم المحلل يكون واعي للانحيازات اللي ممكن تأثر على تحليله.
    
- يُفضل استخدام تقنيات تحليل منظمة (Structured Techniques) عشان يقلل الانحياز ويقوي الاستنتاج.







Structured Analytic Techniques
Structured analytic techniques (SATs) are tools to assist analysts at deriving better analysis through the
abstraction of their biases. SATs are divided into families depending on what part of the analytic process they
support. Almost all SATs include two key tasks:

Decomposition - Breaking down a problem into its components so they can be considered separately.
Visualization - Capturing the parts of a problem in an organized, often visual, manner to better understand
how the parts are interrelated and facilitate analysis. 

Request for Information (RFIs) generally describe a request by analysts focusing on one phase of the cycle for
more information from analysts in another phase of the cycle. This could include subject matter expertise in
areas unfamiliar to the requesting party, a clarification on processed data, or tasking to collect additional data, to
amplify analysis.




## CTI Terminology

These terms are used loosely throughout our industry, so they are often misunderstood. In this course, we adhere to the following definitions:

- **An adversary or threat** is a representation of the human behind the keyboard. It can be the individual, team, or a government. Defining what the specifics of a threat means requires different models (See: Threat Actor). The important understanding of a threat is that it is the entity involved in the execution of an intrusion. We use the term threat interchangeably with adversary. Note that a threat is not a vulnerability (as used in Microsoft's threat modeling, which really is modeling vulnerabilities), nor is it a tool (such as a piece of malicious code).

- **Intelligence requirement** is the simply worded and straightforward single question that drives the intelligence life cycle. It is easily thought of as a pain point or knowledge gap as it relates to the adversary that an organization seeks to satisfy.
  
- **An intrusion** is any successful or failed attempt by the adversary to compromise a system.
  
- **An intrusion set** is a term used to describe the linking of multiple intrusions together, usually when there are key indicator overlaps especially across 2+ phases of the kill chain.
  
- **An activity group** is a set of events and activity associated by similarities in their features and weighted by confidence scoring. Simply put, it is a clustering of intrusions with weighting on the Adversary, Infrastructure, Tradecraft (Capability/TTP), and/or Victim of the intrusions that meets some analytical requirement.
	- An intrusion set would be a clustering and linking of intrusions on key indicators, whereas an Activity Group is a cluster you're tracking that's specific to an analytical requirement or intelligence requirement. A slight nuance but Activity Groups are more formal and meet a more structured purpose.
	  
- A Threat Actor is the threat (person/team/organization/etc.) that is responsible for intrusions and is uniquely tracked across different intrusions. Simply put, it is a clustering of intrusions that focuses on an intelligence requirement to identify who is responsible for intrusions. That is, it is an attribution-based clustering. Attribution does not have to be true attribution (e.g., it's Russia) but can be an abstraction (e.g., FUZZYSNUGGLYDUCK) to continue to track the threat even when elements of their intrusions are not consistent or related in victims, tradecraft, or infrastructure.
- **A campaign or operation** is the adversary's mission focus, such as a malicious group of adversaries targeting financial networks.
  
- **TLP** is the Traffic Light Protocol and is a standard for information sharing that uses White, Green, Amber, and Red as banners to identify who information can be shared to.
  
- **A victim** is an individual, network, or system compromised in the course of achieving an objective.
  
- **A target** is the intended victim of an intrusion.
  
- **A persona** is the fake name or identifier that an adversary takes; it can be operated by one or more adversaries operating on the same or different groups.
  
- **A TTP stands for Tactic, Technique, and Procedure**. A tactic is the higher-level tradecraft that the adversary intends to use to reach an objective (e.g., compromise a domain controller to get passwords to target accounts). A technique is the manner to which the adversary is going to accomplish that tactic (e.g., leveraging a specific exploit to gain access to the domain controller). A procedure is the more granular approach to accomplishing the technique (e.g., the commands typed to launch the exploit).
  
- **Tradecraft** is the combination of methods, capabilities, and resources (such as infrastructure) that an adversary leverages in the course of their actions. TTPs and tradecraft can sometimes be interchanged, but there is a subtle difference. TTP is a grouping of the way adversaries complete their actions.
  
  Tradecraft is broader and can be thought of as the M.O. (modus operandi) of the adversary; not only the way they perform their actions, but what they choose to leverage in performing them. TTPs are often extended to include tradecraft elements, such as specific toolkits, but should not be. As an example, an adversary could leverage a phishing email to drop malicious code on a system (TTPs). The malicious code could be a specific backdoor that's leveraged and consistently identified in use by the adversary to gain access followed by a different set of TTPs. That is, tradecraft can be more specific but also include different clustering of TTPs (being broader in its application). Tradecraft most commonly aligns in our field to activity groups, as it may represent different clusters of intrusions that represent different aspects of TTPs.

---
### Intelligence Requirements
Intelligence requirements are the objectives that analysts seek to satisfy through the intelligence process. 
Our finalized intelligence products should meet those requirements and guide how we do the process such as collection, exploitation, and analysis of the data. 
an intelligence requirement is "A requirement for intelligence to fill a gap in the command's knowledge or understanding of the operational environment of threat forces." , or we'll use the definition: A knowledge gap that needs addressing to enable action.

Intelligence requirements need to be simple and support a single decision by decision makers. The focus on specific events, facts, and activity will also help avoid nebulous requirements such as "Will we be attacked?" It is a best practice to keep intelligence requirements visible to everyone on the team and make them visible to the consumers as well. We want our consumers to have direct input into the intelligence requirement process because it is a bad habit to let the intelligence team define these on their own-we are not the consumers of our own intelligence.


Intrusions

The core of all cyber threat intelligence is intrusion analysis. 
Intrusions are any attempt, successful or failed, that the adversary makes to compromise or attack systems. 
Even failed intrusions have a lot of information that we can gather for analysis.

# Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) - Simple Explanation  

## Colors and When to Use Them  

### **RED**  
- **When to use**: For very sensitive information that could harm someone’s privacy, reputation, or work if shared wrongly.  
- **Sharing rule**: Only discuss it with the people directly involved. Do **not** share it with anyone else.  

### **AMBER**  
- **When to use**: For information that needs teamwork to act on but could still cause harm if shared too widely.  
- **Sharing rule**: Only share with people in your organization who **need to know** to help.  

### **GREEN**  
- **When to use**: For useful information that can be shared with trusted groups or partners in your field.  
- **Sharing rule**: Share with other organizations you work with, but **not** publicly (e.g., no social media or open websites).  

### **WHITE**  
- **When to use**: For safe, non-sensitive information that’s okay for everyone to see.  
- **Sharing rule**: Can be shared freely, but respect copyright rules.  

**TL;DR**:  
- **RED** = Only for the people in the room.  
- **AMBER** = Only for your team (if they need it).  
- **GREEN** = Share with trusted partners, but not publicly.  
- **WHITE** = Share anywhere.

---


**Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)** is a system used in threat intelligence to control how sensitive information is shared.

- **TLP:RED** – For named recipients only. No further sharing allowed.
- **TLP:AMBER** – Can be shared within your organization only.
- **TLP:AMBER+STRICT** – Can be shared only within a specific part of your organization.
- **TLP:GREEN** – Can be shared with peers and partner organizations, not publicly.
- **TLP:WHITE** – No restrictions. Can be shared publicly.
