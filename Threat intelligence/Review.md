# Threat Intelligence (TI) Overview

## Introduction to Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

- CTI focuses on data collection and information analysis to gain a better understanding of threats facing an organization.
- Intelligence can be classified by:
  - **Time dedicated**: Long-term vs. short-term intelligence
  - **Form**: Strategic, tactical, or operational intelligence

## Intelligence Levels

### Strategic Level
- Informs top decision makers (C-suite: CEO, CFO, COO, CIO, CSO, CISO)
- Focuses on high-level trends, risks, and business impacts

### Operational Level
- Supports day-to-day decision making for resource allocation
- Provides information about:
  - Groups targeting the organization
  - Most recently active threat actors

### Tactical Level
- Delivers immediate, actionable information
- Includes indicators like:
  - IP addresses, domains, URLs
  - Hashes, registry keys, email artifacts
- Used for alert context and incident response prioritization

## Threat Actor Characteristics
Any threat actor can be defined by:
- Its type
- Its motivations
- Its sophistication level
- Its intended effect
- The campaigns it was involved in
- Its Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

## ==The Intelligence Cycle==
A six-phase process: (Planning - collection - processing - analysis - Dissemination - Report)

1. **1.** **Planning and Direction:**
    This initial phase involves identifying the intelligence requirements, determining the scope of the analysis, and outlining the collection strategy. It includes defining the specific questions that need to be answered and deciding which methods and sources will be used to gather information. 
    
2. **2.** **Collection:**
    This stage focuses on gathering raw data from various sources. These sources can include open-source information (like news articles and social media), human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT), and more. 
    
3. **3.** **Processing:**
    The collected data is then transformed into a usable format. This may involve translating information, organizing it into databases, and creating searchable formats. 
    
4. **4.** **Analysis:**
    In this crucial step, the processed information is analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and potential threats. Analysts evaluate the data, assess its reliability, and draw conclusions based on the available evidence. 
    
5. **5.** **Dissemination:**
    The analyzed intelligence is then communicated to the relevant decision-makers or stakeholders. This ensures that those who need the information can use it to make informed decisions. 
    
6. **6.** **Feedback:**
    The final stage involves gathering feedback on the intelligence products and the overall process. This feedback helps refine the intelligence cycle, improve future analyses, and ensure that the process remains effective.


### **Scenario: Preventing a Terrorist Attack**

#### **1. Planning & Direction**
- **Tasking:** A national security agency receives vague reports about a potential terrorist threat in a major city.
- **Priority:** The agency defines its intelligence requirements—identifying the group involved, their plans, and possible targets.

#### **2. Collection**
- **Methods Used:**
    - **HUMINT (Human Intelligence):** An undercover agent infiltrates a suspected group.
    - **SIGINT (Signals Intelligence):** Monitoring encrypted communications between suspects.
    - **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence):** Scanning social media for extremist propaganda.
- **Data Gathered:** The group is planning a bomb attack on a subway station next week.

#### **3. Processing**
- **Decryption:** Breaking coded messages between operatives.
- **Translation:** Converting intercepted foreign-language communications.
- **Organizing:** Structuring raw data into usable reports.

#### **4. Analysis**
- **Assessment:** Analysts determine:
    - The credibility of the threat.
    - Likely targets and methods.
    - Possible collaborators.
- **Conclusion:** The threat is credible, with a high likelihood of an attack in 5 days.

#### **5. Dissemination**
- **Report Format:** A classified intelligence brief is prepared.
- **Recipients:** Shared with law enforcement, counterterrorism units, and government officials.

#### **6. Feedback & Reevaluation**
- **Response:** Police increase security at subway stations.
- **New Intel:** Surveillance confirms suspects are conducting reconnaissance.
- **Cycle Repeats:** Updated intelligence leads to the arrest of the cell before the attack

## **Step 5: Generate Threat Intelligence Report**
### **Structure of the Report:**  
1. **Executive Summary** (High-level threats, key findings).  
2. **Threat Landscape Overview** (APT groups, malware trends).  
3. **IOCs & TTPs** (Tables of malicious IPs, hashes, MITRE mappings).  
4. **Vulnerabilities Affecting Company X** (CVE list, patch status).  
5. **Dark Web & Leak Monitoring** (Credentials, insider threats).  
6. **Recommendations** (Mitigation steps, detection rules).  

### **Tools for Reporting:**  
- **Maltego** (visualization).  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (data analysis).  
- **Microsoft Word / Markdown** (report formatting).  

---

## **Step 6: Disseminate & Operationalize Intelligence**
### **Goal:**  
Ensure security teams can act on findings.

### **Actions:**  
1. **Integrate IOCs into Security Tools:**  
   - **SIEM (Splunk, ELK)** → Alert on malicious IPs.  
   - **EDR (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne)** → Block malware hashes.  
   - **Firewalls (Palo Alto, Fortinet)** → Update blocklists.  

2. **Share with Stakeholders:**  
   - **TI Platforms (MISP, ThreatConnect)** for collaboration.  
   - **Incident Response Team** for proactive hunting.  

3. **Automate Threat Feeds (Optional):**  
   - **TheHive + Cortex** (automated IOC enrichment).  

---

## **Step 7: Continuous Monitoring & Feedback**
### **Goal:**  
Keep the threat landscape updated.

### **Tools & Processes:**  
- **Automated OSINT:** **SpiderFoot**, **Recon-ng**.  
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs):** **Anomali STAXX**, **Recorded Future**.  
- **Periodic Review:** Quarterly threat landscape updates.  

---

## **Final Notes**
- **Automation is Key:** Use **Python (Requests, BeautifulSoup)** for scraping, **YARA** for malware detection.  
- **Stay Updated:** Follow **@vxunderground**, **@Unit42_Intel**, **@CISAgov** for emerging threats.  

This structured approach ensures **Company X** gets a **comprehensive, actionable threat intelligence report** tailored to its risk exposure.  



####  Do you have any experience developing threat models for organizations?

Threat modeling is an essential part of a threat intelligence analyst’s job. It involves understanding the potential threats an organization might face, and then developing strategies to mitigate those risks. It’s important for potential hires to have a good understanding of the process

**Q:** _How would you assess the quality of a threat intelligence feed before integrating it into your SIEM/SOC?_
**A:**
- **Relevance:** Does it align with our industry (e.g., financial sector vs. healthcare)?
- **False Positive Rate:** Test a sample of IOCs in a sandbox to see if they trigger malicious activity.
- **Timeliness:** Are indicators stale (e.g., domains registered years ago with no recent activity)?
- **Context:** Does it include TTPs, actor attribution, or just raw IOCs?
- **Operational Impact:** Will it overwhelm analysts with noise? (Example: A feed with 10,000 IPs but only 5% malicious is low-value.)


**Q:** _How would you differentiate between a state-sponsored attack and a cybercriminal operation based on incident artifacts?_
**A:**
- **Tradecraft:** State-sponsored actors use custom malware (e.g., APT29’s “WellMess”), while cybercriminals rely on commodity malware (e.g., Emotet, TrickBot).
- **Targeting:** APTs focus on long-term espionage (lateral movement, data exfiltration), while criminals go for quick financial gain (ransomware, credential theft).
- **Infrastructure:** APTs use bulletproof hosting or compromised legitimate domains; criminals favor disposable domains.
- **Persistence:** APTs invest in stealthy backdoors (e.g., webshells), while criminals may rely on scheduled tasks.
- **Intel Sources:** Check reports from Mandiant, CrowdStrike, or government advisories (CISA, NCSC) for overlaps.


**Q:** _You discover two malware campaigns using similar C2 infrastructure. How would you determine if they’re from the same threat actor or a false flag?
**A:**
- **Code Analysis:**
    - Compare **code signing certificates**, obfuscation methods, or API hashing.
- **Infrastructure Overlap:**
    - Check **shared IPs, registrant emails**, or TLS certificate issuers.
- **Victimology:**
    - Same industries? Geographic focus?
- **TTPs:**
    - Do both use **Cobalt Strike with similar sleep timers**?
    - Differences in **lateral movement** (WMI vs. PsExec)?
- **Attribution Warnings:**
    - **False flags** may mimic known groups (e.g., Chinese APTs using Russian malware).



**Q:** _How would you integrate OSINT, HUMINT, and SIGINT to profile a threat actor?_
**A:**
- **OSINT:**
    - **Dark web forums** (RaidsForums, XSS) for chatter.
    - **GitHub leaks** (malware source code, configs).
- **HUMINT:**
    - **Law enforcement liaisons** for insider info (e.g., arrested affiliates).
    - **Trusted industry sharing** (ISACs, closed Telegram groups).
- **SIGINT:**
    - **Intercepted C2 traffic** (if legally obtainable).
    - **SSL certificate patterns** (e.g., APT29’s use of Let’s Encrypt).
- **Correlation:**
    - Combine **forum aliases** with malware hashes.
    - Cross-check **Bitcoin wallets** from ransom payments with blockchain analysis.
